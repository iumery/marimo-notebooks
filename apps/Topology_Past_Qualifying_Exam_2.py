Now for each point $a$ in $A$ assign it with $U(a)$ such that $U(a)$ is disjoint with some $U_a(x)$, neighborhood of $x$ (we can do that because $X$ is Hausdorff), now the collection $\lbrace U(a) \rbrace$ (more precisely it is $U(a) \cap A$, but it is not important here) for an open covering for $A$ thus admit a finite covering.

    We need to show $F$ is an immersion, injective and proper.

    1. For any $p$, $dF_p = (1,df_p)$ is never zero so it is injective, i.e. $F$ immersion;

    3. $F$ is a continuous map from compact $X$ to Hausdorff $X \times Y$ thus it is proper.

    By the way, actually we do not need to require $X,Y$ to be compact: consider any open set in $X \times Y$, since we have the product topology open set are of the form $U\times V$ where $U$ open in $X$ and $V$ open in $Y$, and the preimage is just $U$ by the construction, now if $U\times V$ is compact, then it is closed and bounded, so $U$ is closed, because it is preimage of closed set under continuous $F$, $U$ is bounded because $U \times V$ is bounded.

Thus $B_X$ is an open set in $X$ containing $x$ whose image is contained in open set containing $d_A(x)$, since $x, V$ are arbitrary, $d_A$ is continuous;
    2. If $x \in \overline{A}$, $0$ is a lower bound for any metric thus $d_A(x) \ge 0$. Suppose $d_A(x) > 0$. $x \in \overline{A} \implies B = B_d(x, d_A(x))$ is a basis element of $(X, d)$ containing $x$ and it must intersect $A$. Say $a_0 \in A \cap B$, then $a_0 \in A$ and by definition $a_0 \in B \implies d(x, a_0) < d_A(x)$, thus $d_A(x)$ is not the $\inf$. Thus $d_A(x) = 0$;
    	If $d_A(x) = 0$: if $x \notin \overline{A}$, then there exists basis element $B$ containing $x$ that does not intersect $A$. WLOG say $B = B_d(x, r)$ be a ball centered at $x$ with radius $r (> 0)$, then we have $\forall a \in A, a \notin B \implies d(x, a) \ge r$. Then $r$ is a lower bound of $d(x, a)$ that is greater than $0$, thus $d_A(x) \ge r > 0$ which is a contradiction. Thus $x \in \overline{A}$.

    **Prove that a compact subset of a Hausdorff space is closed**.

    Idea:

    It is very similar with the proof that compact Hausdorff space is regular/normal: for any $x$ that is not in the subset, use compactness of the subset to find a neighborhood of $x$ that is disjoint with that subset, since this work for all $x$, it means complement of the subset is open thus the subset itself is closed.

    Idea:

    Since $A$ is proper, there exists some $x \in X-A$, clearly $x$ and $A$ are both closed and they are disjoint, so we can apply the Urysohn Lemma to get a continuous $f: X\to [0,1]$, $f(A) = 0$ and $f(x) = 1$. Now this map is surjective: because if some $c$ is not attained, it means the image of $X$ under $f$ is not connected, that cannot happen. Now, map this interval to $S^1$ by joining $0,1$ together at the point $(0,1)$, call this map $g$, then the composition $gf$ is what we want: it is continuous and surjective, and $g(f(A)) = g(0) = (0,1)$. The preimage is not really $A$ but fortunately we did not require that.

    Idea:

    Let $F:\mathbb{R}^2 - \lbrace 0 \rbrace \to S^1$ be the map $x \to x/\| x \|$, since we took $0$ out this map is continuous, thus by the universal mapping property of quotient topology, we have that the map $f:\mathbb{R}^2-\lbrace 0 \rbrace/\sim \to S^1, [x] \to x/\| x\|$ is continuous. It is also not hard to check it is bijection, and a bijective quotient map is always a homeomorphism.

    Idea:

    Let $z \in Z-Y$ and that $y = r(z) \in Y$, so that $z \ne y$. Since we are in a Hausdorff space, we can find $U(z), U(y)$ disjoint open set containing $z,y$ respectively. Now claim, the set $r^{-1}(U(y) \cap Y) \cap U(z)$ is a neighborhood of $z$ contained in $Z-Y$: it contains $z$, because $U(z)$ contains $z$ and image of $z$ is in $U(y)$ (and of course in $Y$) thus $z$ is in the preimage; it is open because $U(y) \cap Y$ is open in $Y$ (with subspace topology); it is disjoint from $Y$, because if a point $p$ in $r^{-1}(U(y) \cap Y) \cap U(z)$ is in $Y$, then $r(p) = p$ is also in $Y$, in particular $r(p) \in U(z)$ (use the right half), however since $p$ also in $r^{-1}(U(y) \cap Y)$, it means $r(p)$ is also in $U(y) \cap Y$, in particular in $U(y)$, but they should be disjoint.

    With this claim proved, we have $Z-Y$ open so $Y$ is closed.

    For any $x' \in X$, since $X$ is a smooth manifold, it is locally homeomorphic to an open ball in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is path-connected, so $x'$ has some neighborhood that is path-connected, so this neighborhood lies either entirely in $U$ or entirely in $X-U$, this proves that both $U$ and $X-U$ are open.
