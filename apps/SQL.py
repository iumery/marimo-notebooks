    # SQL Practice with the DVDRental Dataset

    As part of my ongoing effort to stay sharp in SQL and relational database design, Iâ€™ve been regularly solving practice problems using the DVDRental sample database, a widely used dataset that simulates the operations of a DVD rental store. It offers enough complexity to reflect real-world schemas, including foreign keys, many-to-many relationships, and temporal fields.

    You can find the dataset [here](https://neon.com/postgresql/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database). The goal is to strengthen both query writing and data reasoning, with each challenge grounded in a realistic business scenario. All queries are written in PostgreSQL, but should be easily adapted to other SQL dialects.
