    ## Problem 30: Category Switcher After High Activity

    Goal: Identify customers who rented 10+ films from a single category in a single calendar month, but then *completely stopped* renting that category in the following month.

    Requirements:

    - Use the dvdrental database.
    - Identify customer_id, full name, the category name, the high-activity month (e.g., 2005-06),
      and the number of rentals in that peak month.
    - Exclude customers who returned to the same category later.

    Hints:

    - Use DATE_TRUNC('month', rental_date) for monthly grouping.
    - Only consider categories with 10+ rentals in the peak month.
    - "Completely stopped" = 0 rentals in that category the next month.
    - Assume the data spans multiple months â€” edge cases at the end of dataset are okay to ignore.
