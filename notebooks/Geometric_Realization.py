    # Abstract Simplicial Complexes and Geometric Realization

    In topological data analysis (TDA), we often construct simplicial complexes from data, but itâ€™s important to distinguish between two closely related notions:

    - Abstract simplicial complexes: purely combinatorial structures.
    - Geometric realizations: embeddings of these combinatorial structures into Euclidean space.

    This notebook provides a simple illustration of both concepts.

    ## Abstract Simplicial Complexes

    Given a finite set of vertices $V$, an abstract simplicial complex is a collection of finite subsets of $V$ that is closed under inclusion. That is, if $\sigma \subseteq V$ is in the complex, then every subset of $\sigma$ is also in the complex.

    In this notebook, we simply construct the full simplex on a given vertex set: that is, the set of all possible non-empty subsets of $V$.

    For example, with $5$ vertices $\{A, B, C, D, E\}$, the full simplicial complex consists of:

    - $5$ vertices ($0$-simplices),
    - $10$ edges ($1$-simplices),
    - $10$ triangles ($2$-simplices),
    - $5$ tetrahedra ($3$-simplices),
    - $1$ full $4$-simplex (the entire vertex set).

    This is simply the combinatorial power set (minus the empty set).

    ## Geometric Realization

    An abstract simplicial complex can be embedded into Euclidean space to obtain a geometric realization. This allows us to:

    - Visualize simplices as actual geometric objects (points, edges, triangles, tetrahedra, etc);
    - Perform computations in geometry (e.g., barycentric coordinates, volumes, embeddings).

    In this notebook, we perform a simple random geometric realization of simplices into Euclidean space, simply assigning random coordinates to each vertex for illustration purposes.

    ## Combinatorial Optimization Example

    We also introduce a simple toy example of combinatorial optimization over a simplicial complex: Given an objective function (here: minimizing the size of a simplex), we search for the simplex in the complex that minimizes this function. Of course, with this dummy objective function, the optimizer simply returns a $0$-simplex (vertex).

    In more realistic settings, one could design much more meaningful objective functions depending on the application (e.g., minimizing volume, maximizing weight, minimizing persistence, etc).
