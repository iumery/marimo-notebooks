    ## Problem 21: First-Time Drugâ€“Condition Trials in the Last 5 Years

    Goal: Identify trials from the past 5 years where a drug was tested with a condition for the first time in recorded AACT history.

    Requirements:

    - Use the AACT database.
    - Define a drug-condition pair as (intervention_name, condition_name), where intervention_type = 'Drug'
    - For each such pair, determine the **earliest trial start_date** in AACT history.
    - Then identify whether that **first occurrence** happened in the past 5 years.
    - Output: nct_id, intervention_name, condition_name, first_trial_start_date
    - Only include pairs where the first trial was in the past 5 years (relative to today).
    - Order by first_trial_start_date DESC
