    ## Problem 25: Genre Loyalty and Churn Detection

    Goal: Identify customers who were highly loyal to a single genre for a period of time, but later switched to predominantly renting from a different genre.

    Requirements:

    - Use the dvdrental database.
    - For each customer with at least 15 rentals, track their rental history **chronologically**.
    - Determine the **main genre** in the first half of their rentals (most frequent category).
    - Determine the **main genre** in the second half of their rentals.
    - If these two main genres are different, count them as "genre switchers".
    - Output: customer_id, first_half_genre, second_half_genre, total_rentals
    - Only include customers where:
        - total_rentals â‰¥ 15
        - main genres in first vs second half are different
